Static Keyword:

	Static Class
	Static Method
	Static Constructor
	Static Data Member
	
-----------------------------

Static Data Member:

	- Static Data Member gets memory only once for a class.
	- All the objects can share the same copy of static data members.

Static Constructor:

	- Static Constructor is to initialized the static data members.
	- Static Constructor cannot have any parameter.
	- In a class, we can have only one static constructor.
	- Along with static constructors, we can also have Instance Constructor.
	- We can have static constructor also along with default instance constructor
	
Static Method:

	- Static Method is similar to Instance Method.
	- They can be accessed directly by using class name rather than Object.
	- If you try to access by instance of the class, it will give error.
	- We can display or implement the generic functionality using static method.

Static Class:

	- contains only static members means static data members and methods.
	- cannot be instantiated by using new keyword.
	- By default, static classes are sealed means they can also not be inherited.
	- can have default constructor and can have only one constructor.
	- Access Modifers are not allowed on static constructors.
	- The members of static class can be accessed by class Name.
	
-----------------------------

Arrays:
	
	- A variable that is used to store a literal value, but an array is used to store multiple literal values.
	
		int number;		// Variable
		
		int[] numbers;	// Array
